# Weather Journal

This project is an asynchronous web app for journal writing. Date and weather stamps will be generated automatically based on the zip code typed.

## Getting Started

### Setup

Before you start, you will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.


### Install

To run the App, enter `npm run start` in the terminal.

**The app will run at port 3000.**

## App Usage

Type in zip code and content of the journal to generate the result.

_Example: Some valid zip codes in the US are 98105 (Seattle), and 10001 (New York)_

### Change Country

The App will only accept zip code in the US by default. To change the country, simply change the `countrycode` variable in the `app.js` file.

_Note: Country switching feature in progress._
